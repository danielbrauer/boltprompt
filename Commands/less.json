When text color is specified by both an\nuppercase letter and a lowercase letter, the uppercase letter\ntakes precedence.  For example, error messages are normally\ndisplayed as standout text.  So if both \u0022s\u0022 and \u0022E\u0022 are given a\ncolor, the \u0022E\u0022 color applies to error messages, and the \u0022s\u0022\ncolor applies to other standout text.  The \u0022d\u0022 and \u0022u\u0022 letters\nrefer to bold and underline text formed by overstriking with\nbackspaces (see the -u option), not to text using ANSI escape\nsequences with the -R option.\nA lowercase letter may be followed by a \u002B to indicate that both\nthe normal format change and the specified color should both be\nused.  For example, -Dug displays underlined text as green\nwithout underlining; the green color has replaced the usual\nunderline formatting.  But -Du\u002Bg displays underlined text as\nboth green and in underlined format.\ncolor is either a 4-bit color string or an 8-bit color string:\nA 4-bit color string is zero, one or two characters, where the\nfirst character specifies the foreground color and the second\nspecifies the background color as follows:\nb      Blue\nc      Cyan\ng      Green\nk      Black\nm      Magenta\nr      Red\nw      White\ny      Yellow\nThe corresponding upper-case letter denotes a brighter shade of\nthe color.  For example, -DNGk displays line numbers as bright\ngreen text on a black background, and -DEbR displays error\nmessages as blue text on a bright red background.  If either\ncharacter is a \u0022-\u0022 or is omitted, the corresponding color is set\nto that of normal text.\nAn 8-bit color string is one or two decimal integers separated\nby a dot, where the first integer specifies the foreground color\nand the second specifies the background color.  Each integer is\na value between 0 and 255 inclusive which selects a \u0022CSI 38;5\u0022\ncolor value (see\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parameters)\nIf either integer is a \u0022-\u0022 or is omitted, the corresponding\ncolor is set to that of normal text.  On MS-DOS versions of\nless, 8-bit color is not supported; instead, decimal values are\ninterpreted as 4-bit CHAR_INFO.Attributes values (see\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/char-info-str)",

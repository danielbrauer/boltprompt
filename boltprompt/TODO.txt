- developer workflow
- rename
- handle command/arg description vs file description
- file description is too slow
- syntax highlighting?
- add readme
- duplicate commands for cp
- make history working directory sensitive
- configurability
- other shell support
- autocomplete suggestions for:
-- sudo commands
-- kill signals
-- killall processes
-- git branches


Done:

- dont show pending message if no suppliers
- build and install process
- `history` support
- handle wrapping of command line
